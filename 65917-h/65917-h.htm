<h2 id="c1"><span class="small"><i>Welcome</i></span></h2>
<p>The superintendent and the staff of
Crater Lake National Park welcome you
to this area of the National Park System.
We hope that your stay here will be
pleasant and inspiring.</p>
<p>Here in this park you encounter
beauty&mdash;beauty in a wonderful combination
of form and substance and sparking
color&mdash;great curving walls of rock and
sand, green spires of fir and hemlock,
and the brilliant reflections of Crater
Lake. All this is a part of a remarkable
volcanic story.</p>
<p>On this spot, a few thousand years
ago, stood the mighty 12,000-foot volcano,
Mount Mazama. This great mountain
discharged a tremendous quantity
of ash and lava, causing the mountaintop
to collapse, and creating a caldera, which
now contains the unbelievably blue
Crater Lake. It is the central feature of
this 250-square-mile National Park on
the crest of the Cascade Range in southern
Oregon.</p>
<p>A major charm of Crater Lake is that
the whole lake and its setting can be
taken in by the eye at one time. Yet its
size is impressive. The lake is about 20
square miles in area, 6 miles wide, and
has 20 miles of shoreline. The surrounding
cliffs rise as much as 2,000
feet to the uneven crater rim which averages
about 7,000 feet in elevation.</p>
<div class="box">
<h3 class="center">WILD ANIMALS</h3>
<p>It is dangerous for you to get near wild animals though they may appear tame.
Some have become accustomed to humans, but they still are wild and may
seriously injure you if you approach them. Regulations prohibiting feeding,
teasing, touching, or molesting wild animals are enforced for your safety.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small"><i>Discovery and History</i></span></h2>
<p>The Klamath Indians knew of, but
seldom visited Crater Lake. They regarded
the lake and the mountain as
the battleground of the gods. The lake
was discovered on June 12, 1853, by
John Wesley Hillman, a young prospector
leading a party in search of a rumored
&ldquo;Lost Cabin Mine.&rdquo; Having
failed in their efforts, Hillman and his
party returned to Jacksonville, a mining
camp in the Rogue River Valley, and
reported their discovery which they had
named Deep Blue Lake.</p>
<p>On October 21, 1862, Chauncey Nye,
leading a party of prospectors from eastern
Oregon to Jacksonville, happened
upon the lake. Thinking that they had
made a discovery, they named it Blue
Lake. A third &ldquo;discovery&rdquo; was made
on August 1, 1865, by two soldiers stationed
at Fort Klamath, who called it
Lake Majesty. In 1869 this name was
changed to Crater Lake by visitors from
Jacksonville.</p>
<p>Before 1885 Crater Lake had few visitors
and was not widely known. On
August 15 of that year William Gladstone
Steel, after 15 years of effort to
get to the lake, stood for the first time
on its rim. Inspired by its beauty,
Steel conceived the idea of preserving
it as a National Park. For 17 years,
with much personal sacrifice, he devoted
time and energy to this end. Success
was realized when the park was established
on May 22, 1902, with W. F.
Arant as its first superintendent. Steel
continued to devote his life to development
of the park, serving as its second
superintendent and later as park commissioner,
which office he held until his
death in 1934.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small"><i>The Geological Story of Crater Lake</i></span></h2>
<h3 class="inline"><span class="sc">Origin of the Mountain.</span></h3>
<p>The
slope, which you ascend to view the
lake, and the caldera wall rising 500 to
2,000 feet above the water, are remnants
of Mount Mazama.</p>
<p>In comparatively recent geologic time,
numerous volcanic peaks were formed
near the western edge of a vast lava
plateau covering parts of Oregon,
Washington, Idaho, Montana, Nevada,
and California. These are the Cascade
Range, of which Mount Mazama was
one of the commanding peaks. It was
built by successive lava flows with some
accumulation of volcanic ash. The cone
thus formed was modified by streams
and glaciers which carved valleys in its
sides and deposited rock debris on its
flanks. The layered character and different
formations of the mountain are
now clearly exposed in numerous places
within the caldera wall.</p>
<h3 class="inline"><span class="sc">Forming of Dikes.</span></h3>
<p>In addition to
broad surface flows, it is common for
molten lava to be squeezed into cracks,
or fissures, that develop in a volcano.
Such filling results in dikes, or walls,
frequently harder than the enclosing
rock. At Crater Lake the destruction of
the mountain and subsequent erosion
have exposed numerous dikes in the wall,
of which the Devil&rsquo;s Backbone on the
west wall is an outstanding example.</p>
<h3 class="inline"><span class="sc">Action of Streams and Glaciers.</span></h3>
<p>In the layers forming the crater wall
there is evidence of the action of water.
In some places this is shown by the cutting
of valleys; in others, by the accumulation
of water-carried gravel and
boulders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>Glacial ice, carrying sand, pebbles, and
boulders, scratches and polishes rock
surfaces over which it moves. Glacial
polish and thick beds of glacial debris
are common around the mountain. They
occur on the surface rock and between
earlier layers, showing that glaciers existed
at various stages in the history of
the mountain.</p>
<p><span class="ss">U</span>-shaped valleys, such as Kerr Notch,
Sun Notch, and Munson Valley on the
southeast slope of Mount Mazama, are
evidence of glaciation. The lava flow
which formed Llao Rock filled an ancient
glacial notch.</p>
<h3 class="inline"><span class="sc">Forming of the Caldera.</span></h3>
<p>Many
geologists have concluded that the basin
occupied by the lake resulted from the
collapse and subsidence of the volcanic
cone of Mount Mazama. This explanation
was first proposed by J. S. Diller,
of the United States Geological Survey,
who considered that the support of the
summit was weakened by drainage of
great quantities of molten rock through
subterranean cracks. The pit thus formed
grew progressively larger in all directions,
as is indicated by the broken edges
exposed around its rim today. Extensive
study by Prof. Howel Williams, of
the University of California, led him to
practically the same conclusion.</p>
<p>In his delightful, popular, and scientifically
accurate book, <i>Crater Lake, The
Story of Its Origin</i>, Williams describes
great quantities of pumice extending
more than 80 miles northeast of Mount
Mazama. This pumice was blown from
the mountain in a catastrophic event and
carried northeastward by the prevailing
winds. Analysis shows that this is material
derived from the heart of the
volcano and not finely divided fragments
of the original mountain walls.</p>
<p>Following this eruption, the crater is
believed literally to have boiled over,
pouring out great quantities of frothy
material as a series of glowing avalanches.
These avalanches must have
traveled at a terrific speed down the valleys,
for those to the south and west
did not begin to deposit their load until
they had reached a distance of 4 to 5
miles. The greater quantity flowed
down the mountain to the south and
southwest for distances up to 35 miles
from the source. The total volume of
the ejected lava was about 5 cubic miles.
It is believed that an additional 1.5 cubic
miles of old rock were carried away at
the same time.</p>
<p>Accompanying these eruptions, which
occurred within the past 7,000 years,
cracks developed in the flanks of the
mountain so that the top collapsed, being
engulfed in the void produced by the
ejection of the pumice and lava and the
withdrawal of 10 cubic miles of molten
rock into swarms of cracks that probably
opened parallel to the axis of the Cascade
Range. Thus was formed the great
pit that was to become Crater Lake.</p>
<p>By projecting the slopes of the mountain
remnant upward, conforming to the
slopes of similar volcanoes, it has been
estimated that approximately 17 cubic
miles of the upper part of ancient Mount
Mazama was destroyed by the collapse.</p>
<h3 class="inline"><span class="sc">The Growth of Wizard Island.</span></h3>
<p>After the destruction of the peak, volcanic
activity within the caldera produced
Wizard Island and perhaps other cones.
These cones rise above a relatively flat
floor, the lowest part of which is almost
2,000 feet below the surface of the
present lake.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<h3 class="inline"><span class="sc">Origin of the Lake.</span></h3>
<p>The water of
Crater Lake comes from rain and snow.
The average annual precipitation is 69
inches. The lake has no inlet and no
outlet, except seepage. Evaporation,
seepage, and precipitation are in a state
of relative balance which maintains an
approximately constant water level. In
1957, the lake level was the highest recorded
since 1908. There is an annual
variation of from 1 to 3 feet, the level
being highest in spring and lowest in
autumn.</p>
<h3 class="inline"><span class="sc">Color of the Lake.</span></h3>
<p>The deep blue
of the lake is believed to be caused chiefly
by the scattering of sunlight in water of
exceptional depth and clearness, the blue
rays of sunlight being bent back upward,
rays of other colors being absorbed.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small"><i>Wildlife</i></span></h2>
<h3 class="inline"><span class="sc">Mammals.</span></h3>
<p>There are about 60 kinds,
of which the golden-mantled ground
squirrels are among the most conspicuous.
They resemble large chipmunks
but have stockier bodies, shorter tails
and no stripes on their heads. On each
side there is a broad, white stripe sandwiched
between two dark stripes. Two
species of true chipmunks with striped
heads also are numerous. The small,
tree-inhabiting chickaree, dark brown
above and whitish below, is common;
and the porcupine is frequently seen.
It is advisable to enjoy these and all
other small mammals without actual
contact because occasionally they carry
diseases which can become serious if
transmitted to humans.</p>
<p>The large fat-bodied marmot (a mountain
woodchuck) lives in high rocky
places and on roadsides. The plaintive
bleating &ldquo;yenk, yenk&rdquo; of the tiny &ldquo;rock
rabbit&rdquo; (cony) issues from crevices in
the talus. Snowshoe hares, brown in
summer and white in winter, are sparingly
present around forest clearings,
such as at the south and east entrances.</p>
<p>Martens are rather common; they are
slim brown animals somewhat like large
minks but they can climb trees like
squirrels. Less often seen are weasels,
badgers, minks, red foxes, and coyotes.
The gray fox, bobcat, and mountain lion
(cougar) are rare.</p>
<p>American black bears are fairly common
and may be encountered in many
parts of the park. Usually they are
black, but many shades of brown also
occur, just as hair color varies among
people. Do not let bears get close to
you. Many people have been painfully
clawed when these animals have lost
their natural fear of man and have
learned to beg for food. DO NOT
FEED THE BEARS! Feeding them is
unlawful, and violating this regulation
seriously endangers other park visitors
by encouraging the bears to beg.</p>
<p>The comparatively small and dark
&ldquo;black-tailed&rdquo; deer of the Pacific Coast
is the most common form, particularly
on the west side of the park. The larger,
lighter-colored mule deer occurs around
meadows on the east side of the park,
including Rim Drive.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<h3 class="inline"><span class="sc">Birds.</span></h3>
<p>More than 120 kinds of birds
have been recorded. On the rim, the
harsh-voiced Clark&rsquo;s nutcracker is the
most conspicuous. It is a little larger
and more heavily built than a jay and
has a long sharp bill. The bird&rsquo;s overall
color is light gray, the wings are
black with a large white patch, and the
tail is conspicuously white with black
central tail feathers. Two jays are also
numerous at times on the rim, the dark-blue
Steller&rsquo;s jay which has a long,
blackish crest, and the uncrested gray
jay (&ldquo;camp robber&rdquo;) which has a short
bill, a dark patch on the back of the head,
a white crown, and whitish underparts.</p>
<p>Eagle Crags have furnished nesting
places for both the golden and American
eagles which sometimes may be seen
flying over the lake. Llao Rock is the
home of falcons. Double-crested cormorants
may perch on the &ldquo;masts&rdquo; of
the Phantom Ship, and California gulls
are seen regularly on the lake. The
sooty grouse inhabits the fir forests from
which its ventriloquial booming call
issues in the spring. Several species of
ducks and geese use the lake during
migration, and the Barrow&rsquo;s golden-eye
and merganser nest there occasionally.</p>
<p>Other species most likely to be observed
are the horned owl, red-tailed
hawk, sparrow hawk, nighthawk, rufous
hummingbird, olive-sided flycatcher,
raven, mountain chickadee, red-breasted
nuthatch, dipper (along streams and on
the lake shore), robin, hermit thrush,
russet-backed thrush, mountain bluebird,
golden-crowned kinglet, Audubon warbler,
western tanager, evening grosbeak,
Cassin purple finch, rosy finch (vicinity
of snow banks), pine siskin, Oregon
junco, chipping sparrow, and fox
sparrow.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small"><i>Forests and Wildflowers</i></span></h2>
<p>The virgin forests and wildflower
meadows mantling the slopes, which one
ascends to view Crater Lake, are outstanding
attractions enhancing the scenic
value of the lake. Scattered through the
forests of predominantly cone-bearing
trees are a few broad-leaved species.
Colorful meadows of alpine wildflowers
are found around numerous springs
which form the sources of many creeks
on the outer slope of the mountain.</p>
<p>Plants characteristic of four zones of
vegetation are found within the park,
yielding over 570 species of ferns and
flowering plants. Patches of Douglas-firs,
typical of the humid division of
the upper Transition Zone, occur in the
region of the park lying on the western
slope of the Cascade Range. The semi-humid
division of the zone, characterized
by the ponderosa pines, largest trees in
the park, may be found at the south entrance
of the park. Associated with it
are sugar pines, white firs, and western
white pines. Above the Transition is
the Canadian Zone in which occur lodgepole
pines, Shasta red firs, alpine firs,
and mountain hemlocks.</p>
<p>In the rim area around Crater Lake,
Hudsonian Zone species are found.
These include mountain hemlocks (the
most predominant trees in the park),
alpine firs, Shasta red firs, and whitebark
pines. Stunted whitebark pines
predominate on the slopes of Mount
Scott, the summit being in the Alpine-Arctic
Zone.</p>
<p>During July and August, you will find
Nature&rsquo;s colorful displays of alpine wildflowers
on the road between park headquarters
and Rim Village and along the
trails on the crater rim. These displays
change with each week of the short flowering
season.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Castle Crest Wildflower Garden, near
park headquarters, is one of the most
attractive and ideal places for viewing
and studying Crater Lake flora.
Throughout the summer, you may study
the exhibits of fresh flowers displayed
at the Information Building in the Rim
Village.</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small"><i>Interpretive Service</i></span></h2>
<p>During the summer, daily interpretive
service is scheduled by the National
Park Service. Informal talks are given
at Sinnott Memorial, and evening programs
are held in the Community House,
both in Rim Village. Field trips start
from the Information Building on the
rim just west of the lodge. Rim Drive
bus trips begin at the lodge. Boat trips,
when in operation, start at the foot of
the Lake (Crater Wall) Trail.</p>
<p>Programs of current interpretive activities
are posted at several places in the
park.</p>
<p>The Sinnott Memorial, with its broad
terrace overlooking the lake, serves as
an orientation point. It is located close
to the lodge and the Rim Campground.
Pictorial displays in the exhibit room
portray artists&rsquo; conceptions of the varying
moods of the lake. Field glasses
and a large relief map of the region are
located on the terrace.</p>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small"><i>What to See and Do</i></span></h2>
<h3 class="inline"><span class="sc">Rim Drive.</span></h3>
<p>Many spectacular views
may be had from numerous observation
points along this road which encircles
the caldera.</p>
<h3 class="inline"><span class="sc">Wizard Island.</span></h3>
<p>This symmetrical
cinder cone, towering some 760 feet
above the surface of the lake, is reached
by boat. A trail leads from the shore
to the crater, which is approximately 90
feet deep and 300 feet in diameter.</p>
<h3 class="inline"><span class="sc">The Phantom Ship.</span></h3>
<p>Rising about
160 feet above the waters of the lake,
this island resembles a ship under sail.
The best views of the Phantom Ship are
obtained from the launches and from
Kerr Notch along the Rim Drive.</p>
<h3 class="inline"><span class="sc">Garfield Peak.</span></h3>
<p>A 1.7-mile trail,
east of the lodge, leads to Garfield Peak.
From its summit, elevation 8,060 feet,
there is a magnificent view of the lake
and surrounding region.</p>
<h3 class="inline"><span class="sc">The Watchman.</span></h3>
<p>This peak, on the
west rim, may be reached by a half-mile
trail from the rim road. A rare panorama
of the park and surrounding country
may be viewed from the fire lookout,
8,025 feet above sea level and about
1,850 feet above the lake.</p>
<h3 class="inline"><span class="sc">Cloudcap.</span></h3>
<p>On the east rim, and rising
to an elevation of more than 8,000
feet, Cloudcap provides an excellent
observation point.</p>
<h3 class="inline"><span class="sc">Mount Scott.</span></h3>
<p>East of Cloudcap is
Mount Scott, the highest point in the
park, reaching an altitude of 8,938 feet.
Its summit, on which there is a fire-lookout
station, is accessible by a 2.5-mile
trail from Rim Drive.</p>
<h3 class="inline"><span class="sc">The Pinnacles.</span></h3>
<p>In Wheeler Creek,
near the east boundary of the park, are
slender spires of pumice. Some of the
needles are 200 feet high. In Sand
Creek Canyon and Godfrey&rsquo;s Glen, in
Annie Creek Canyon, there are other
spires and fluted columns carved out
of the soft volcanic material by water
erosion.</p>
<h3 class="inline"><span class="sc">Other Places of Interest in the Park and Vicinity.</span></h3>
<p>Hillman Peak,
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
8,156 feet, is the highest point on the
rim, rising nearly 2,000 feet above the
lake. Palisade Point, Kerr Notch, and
the Wineglass are low points on the rim,
being slightly more than 500 feet above
the lake.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><span class="sc">Hiking.</span></h3>
<p>Besides the longer hikes
mentioned in preceding paragraphs,
there are delightful short walks, such
as along Discovery Point Trail on the
rim, and through Castle Crest Wildflower
Gardens.</p>
<p>Those who desire information about
other interesting places in the park
and vicinity are invited to inquire at
park headquarters or the Information
Building.</p>
<h3 class="inline"><span class="sc">Fishing.</span></h3>
<p>Angling amid the scenic
beauty of Crater Lake is an experience
long to be remembered. No fish were
native to Crater Lake; the first planting
of rainbow trout was made in 1888
by William G. Steel. In recent years
only rainbow trout and sockeye (kokanee)
salmon have been planted. Trolling
has proved to be the most successful
method of fishing. The daily limit is
10 fish per person. From about mid-July
to Labor Day, rowboats are available.
Shore fishing usually may be enjoyed
from the latter part of June until
late September, depending on weather
conditions. No license is needed to fish
in Crater Lake. Possession or use of fish
as bait is not allowed.</p>
<h3 class="inline"><span class="sc">Winter Visits.</span></h3>
<p>Since the park is
open the year round, you may enjoy
Crater Lake&rsquo;s fantasy of snowy splendor
and participate in winter sports.
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
Two trails from the Rim Village to
park headquarters are maintained for
skiers in winter. Professional ski meets
are discouraged and amateur sports
encouraged.</p>
<p>There are no overnight accommodations
in the park from about September
15 to June 15, but warming-room
facilities are provided at Rim Village.</p>
<p>The west and south entrance roads
to the Rim Village area are open to motor
travel. You should be well supplied
with gasoline and oil, as they are not
available in the park in winter. Tire
chains, tow rope, and shovel are necessary
accessories.</p>
<p>Rangers are on duty to render service
all year.</p>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small"><i>How to Get to the Park</i></span></h2>
<h3 class="inline"><span class="sc">By Common Carrier.</span></h3>
<p>The Southern
Pacific Railroad, several airlines, and bus
lines serve Medford, Klamath Falls, and
Grants Pass, Oreg. Pacific Trailways
buses, operating on daily schedules
through the park, connect with points
north and south from about June 15 to
September 15.</p>
<h3 class="inline"><span class="sc">By Automobile.</span></h3>
<p>Paved State highways
connect with the park road system
at all entrances. State Route 62 connects
the west entrance of the park, through
Medford, with U.S. 99, 199, and 101.
It also leads from the south entrance
to U.S. 97. From the north entrance,
connection is made with U.S. 97 via
State Route 230. The roads through the
west and south entrances to the rim are
maintained as all-year roads. <i>The north
entrance road and Rim Drive are closed
approximately September 25 to July 1
depending on snow conditions.</i></p>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small"><i>Accommodations and Camping</i></span></h2>
<p>Rim Village (900 feet above the lake)
includes the lodge, sleeping cabins, cafeteria,
store, campground, picnic area,
Community House, Information Building,
and Sinnott Memorial. The lake is
accessible by trail from Rim Village.</p>
<h3 class="inline"><span class="sc">Accommodations,</span></h3>
<p>which include
sleeping cabins and single and double
rooms at the lodge, are available from
about June 15 to September 15. Information
regarding rates may be obtained
from the Crater Lake National Park
Company (winter address, Box 968,
Spokane, Wash.; summer, Crater Lake,
Oreg.). It is imperative that reservations
be made well in advance and be
accompanied by a deposit and a request
for confirmation of availability.</p>
<p>There are dining-room facilities in the
lodge. The cafeteria, which is near the
campground and cabins, is open from 7
a. m. to 8:30 p. m.</p>
<h3 class="inline"><span class="sc">Campgrounds.</span></h3>
<p>There are three
main campgrounds open from about July
1 to September 30. <i>Mazama Campground</i>,

<p>A gasoline station is maintained during
summer on the road near park headquarters.
No storage or repair facilities,
however, are available within the park.
In case of accident or mechanical failure,
towing service must be obtained from
outside the park.</p>
<p>Time and place of church services are
posted in the lodge, information building,

<h2 id="c12"><span class="small"><i>Mission 66</i></span></h2>
<p>Mission 66 is a program designed to be
completed by 1966 which will assure the
maximum protection of the scenic, scientific,
wilderness, and historic resources
of the National Park System in such ways
and by such means as will make them
available for the use and enjoyment of
present and future generations.</p>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small"><i>Administration</i></span></h2>
<p>Crater Lake National Park is administered
by the National Park Service of

<p class="center"><i class="b">PARK RANGERS AND NATURALISTS</i></p>
<p>Park rangers are the protective force of the park. They are on duty to enforce
park regulations, and to help and advise you. Consult them if you are in
any difficulty.</p>
<p>Park naturalists are here to help you understand the park. They, too, welcome
your observations and your inquiries.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small"><i>Help Us Protect This Park</i></span></h2>
<p class="tb">Park regulations are designed for the
protection of the natural features and
for your comfort and convenience. The
following synopsis is for your guidance:</p>
<p><span class="sc">Fires.</span> Light carefully and only in
designated campgrounds. Extinguish
completely before leaving camp, even for
a temporary absence. Do not guess your
fire is out&mdash;KNOW IT. One spark
may start a forest fire, destroy the beauty
of the park, and endanger many lives.
Throwing burning materials from car
windows constitutes a fire threat and is
unlawful in most western States.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Camps.</span> Use designated campgrounds
and keep them clean. Burn combustible
rubbish on campfires, and place other
refuse of all kinds in garbage cans or pits
provided for the purpose. Only down
material may be used as firewood.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Trash.</span> Do not throw paper, lunch
refuse, or other trash over the rim, on
walks, trails, roads, or elsewhere.
Carry until you can burn in camp or place
in receptacle.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Trees, Flowers, and Animals.</span> The
destruction, injury, disturbance, or removal
in any way of trees, flowers, birds,
or animals is prohibited in order that
everyone may enjoy the beauties of
nature.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Noises.</span> Please do not be noisy in
camp before 6 a. m. and after 10 p. m.
Many people come to the park for rest.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Automobiles.</span> Drive carefully.
Speeds limits, which vary for different
sections of the park, are posted.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Pets.</span> When not in an automobile,
dogs, cats, and other pets must be on
leash or otherwise under physical
restrictive control at all times. They
are not permitted in the lodge, in the
dining room, the store, other public
buildings or on any of the trails.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Warning About Bears and Deer.</span>
Do not feed, touch, tease, or molest
the bears and deer. Bears will enter or
break into automobiles if food that they
can smell is left inside. They will also
rob your camp of unprotected food
supplies.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Fishing.</span> Open season: Streams, June
15-September 10; Crater Lake, when
trail is open. The limit is 10 fish per
day for each person fishing. No fishing
license is necessary. Possession of
bait fish, or the use thereof as bait, is not
allowed.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Accidents.</span> Report all accidents and
injuries as soon as possible to the ranger
office at park headquarters.</p>
<p>Complete rules and regulations are
available at park headquarters.</p>
<div class="box">
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small"><i>VISITOR USE FEES</i></span></h2>
<p>Automobile, housetrailer, and motorcycle permit fees are collected at entrance stations.
When vehicles enter at times when entrance stations are unattended, it is necessary that
the permit be obtained before leaving the park and be shown upon reentry. The fees
applicable to the park are not listed herein because they are subject to change, but they
may be obtained in advance of a visit by addressing a request to the superintendent.</p>
<p>All national park fees are deposited as revenue in the U. S. Treasury; they offset, in
part, appropriations made for operating and maintaining the National Park System.</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
